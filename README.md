#PhotoSorting
This is a python script for my own images sorting purpose. This script creates folders based on the number of the pictures in the folder, and puts specific numbers(<em>The number is set to be 300 in the script</em>) of pictures in each of them.
I am personally not a professional coder now, but tryint to become one. And most of the codes on my github are for my own study purpuse. The codes will look ugly and unprofessinal, but i will try to impove them as the years progressed.
